# GetAroundUVT
Developed a mobile application named ”GetAroundUVT”, which is designed to improve indoor navigation and interaction within the campus of West University of Timisoara. With an interface implemented using SwiftUI, GetAroundUVT helps users to quickly find the direction to several points of interest. The application offers various functionalities, including assistance in locating classrooms on the map, personalized schedules integrated with external calendars and real-time event updates from the university’s Facebook page. The app’s path planning, building navigation and other capabilities were developed using a Python server.
